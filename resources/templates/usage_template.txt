Preface
For this you will need docker compose installed: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

Starting
To start the service run "docker compose up --build -d" in the installation directory.
Now the service runs in the background with the ports specified in the setup.

Stopping
To stop the service run "docker compose down" in the installation directory.
If you want to remove the images and so on created by docker compose add the arguments "--rmi all -v".
